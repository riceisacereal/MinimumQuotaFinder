This mod calculates and highlights the minimum total value of scraps that you can sell to still reach the quota. **The default key to toggle the highlighting is `H`**, but this can be changed in the settings.

The same in essence as: [ScrapCalculator](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/granny/ScrapCalculator/), [CalculateScrapForQuota](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Jazzy/CalculateScrapForQuota/)
Scrap auto-selling mods: [SellMyScrap](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zehs/SellMyScrap/), [SellFromTerminal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/stormytuna/SellFromTerminal/)

- Always finds the most optimal answer quickly (5ms to 1s depending on quota and number of items) using an [optimized algorithm](#explanation-of-algorithm). ([CalculateScrapForQuota](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Jazzy/CalculateScrapForQuota/) uses the same algorithm)

## How the mod works
- **Press `H` to toggle the highlighting/recalculate**
  - The keybind can be changed in the settings.
- When you're on the company moon, all scrap in the environment is taken into account (including scrap on the counter), unless **its y-value is under -30** (somehow dropped over the railings). Otherwise only scrap within the ship is considered.
  - Pros: You can take items outside the ship on the company moon and they will still be included in the calculation.
- If you accidentally sold unhighlighted scrap, press H (or the key you rebound it to) to recalculate.
- Calculation assumes that you are selling when the company is buying at 100%.
  - Selling at other buying rates makes it hard to calculate:
    - The way the buying rate is calculated in-game is by multiplying the total value of everything on the counter by the buying rate, and then getting rid of the decimals. (The result gets assigned to an integer, so 1.1 becomes 1, and 1.8 also becomes 1). 
    - Since you can only put a limited number (12) of scrap on the counter every time, the decimal shave will occur for every batch you sell, decreasing by decimals the total value of your sold scrap. So even if the calculation was smack on the quota at the start, after selling everything you would fall short because of the decimal shaving.
    - Of course, we could calculate every item's buying price before doing the calculations, but due to the algorithm we can't work with real numbers and have to shave off the decimals before calculation, so the considered value of the scrap is lower than its actual value and the result would overshoot. (The amount it overshoots by scales with the amount of scrap you are selling. Let's say on average you shave off 0.5 real value per scrap, if you sell 50 pieces of scrap you'll lose 25 company credits - a whole piece of scrap. At that point it's just better to judge the amount yourself.)
    - To get the most optimal answer in this situation we need to calculate the best order of batches to sell in to minimize scrap value loss, but that's a whole separate challenge which is too big in comparison to the problem it tries to solve.
  - Since this mod is intended for min-maxing gameplay and we see no overwhelming reason that one would sell at a lower buying rate when approaching the game this way, currently we do not have plans to add in a feature for this.
- This is a client-side mod, which means that there is a small chance of different items being highlighted for different people. We have several methods in place to prevent this from happening, but you never know.
  - If this happens, report an issue and tell us how it happened.

## Explanation of Algorithm
### The problem
The problem this mod tries to solve - finding the most optimal combination of scrap that is the closest to the quota, is a variant of the [subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) and has a computational complexity of [NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), which in a very generalized way of saying means that there is no easy formula to get the answer right away and that we have to find it by "trying every combination".

The number of possible combinations for all the scrap you have grows [exponentially](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3788314), by the time you have 20 pieces of scrap you will have to check over 1 million combinations, and 1 billion when you have 30 pieces of scrap. When you're up to 5k+ quota it will take half your lifetime to check all combinations with even if you check 1 million combinations per second.

Algorithms for NP-hard problems utilize ways to [ignore certain combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_pruning), and [storing the results of calculations that are repeated multiple times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). An example of the former would be, if you have a quota of 1000, and we know that the highest value a scrap can have is 210, we could ignore any combinations that have less than 5 pieces of scrap, since they would never reach the quota (4 * 210 = 840 < 1000).

### The Algorithm
The algorithm we've implemented is very similar to the solution to the [0-1 knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0-1_knapsack_problem) which uses dynamic programming and memoization. The only difference is that the knapsack problem tries to find the maximum <= a threshold, and since we need the minimum of >= quota, we ran the knapsack solution on a threshold of (total value of scrap owned - quota) to find what we should *exclude*. (Thanks to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17181101) Stackoverflow answer for the idea.)

### Computation Time Scaling
The 2 factors that determine how long it takes to calculate an answer are the value of the quota, the number of scrap, and the total value of that scrap. The algorithm goes through a table the size of (total value of scrap owned - quota) * number of scrap, so the bigger the difference between your quota and the total value of all your scrap, and the more scrap you have, the longer it takes to calculate.

### Performance Impact
To prevent the game from freezing while doing large calculations, the mod makes use of [coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html). These coroutines spread out the calculations over multiple frames and limit the number of computations ran per frame for a smoother user experience.

## Credits
This mod was built using the [BepInEx mod template](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/2_plugin_start.html). Part of [ShipLoot mod](https://github.com/tinyhoot/ShipLoot)'s code was taken as a starting point. [InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/) was used to make the keybinding. This [Wireframe Shader](https://gist.github.com/baba-s/14ecab2df06188a083e66ab00b2c9499) was used as a basis for the custom wireframe shader.
